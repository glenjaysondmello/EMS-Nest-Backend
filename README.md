# Employee Management System - NestJS

## Description

This is an Employee Management System built with NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The application is designed to manage employee data with features such as creating, updating, fetching, and deleting employees. It integrates Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (via Neon DB), throttling using NestJS throttler, and custom logging with a file system to capture logs.

## Features

- **Employee CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete employees.
- **Throttling**: Rate limiting for specific routes with NestJS throttler.
- **Custom Logging**: Logs requests and errors to a log file using custom logger service.
- **Prisma Integration**: ORM for PostgreSQL with Prisma.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: Framework for building server-side applications.
- **Prisma ORM**: Database ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **PostgreSQL (Neon DB)**: Relational database used for storing employee data.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for better developer tooling.
- **Throttler**: Rate limiting for requests to avoid overloading.
- **Custom Logger**: Logs both to the console and a file system.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [NestJS CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
- [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started)
- [Neon DB](https://neon.tech/): PostgreSQL database.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file for database connection:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>"
   ```

4. Generate Prisma client:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

5. Run the migrations to set up your database schema:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

6. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Prisma Schema

Below is the schema for the `Employee` model used in the project:

```prisma
model Employee {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  email     String   @unique
  role      Role
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

enum Role {
  Intern
  Engineer
  Admin
}
```

## CLI Commands for NestJS

### Create Modules

```bash
nest g module employees
nest g module database
nest g module my-logger
```

### Create Controllers

```bash
nest g controller employees
nest g controller app
```

### Create Services

```bash
nest g service employees
nest g service database
nest g service app
```

### Prisma Commands

- **Create a Prisma Client**:
  
  ```bash
  npx prisma generate
  ```

- **Apply Migrations**:

  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev --name init
  ```

- **Seed Database (Optional)**:

  If you have a seed file (`prisma/seed.ts`), run:

  ```bash
  npx prisma db seed
  ```

## Logging

This project includes custom logging functionality with file logging enabled.

Logs are stored in the `logs/myLogFile.log` file and include formatted timestamps and request details. Here's an example of the log:

```log
1/3/25, 4:13 AM    EmployeesController    Request for ALL Employees    ::1
1/3/25, 4:13 AM    AllExceptionsFilter    ThrottlerException: Too Many Requests
```

### Custom Logger Service

- The `MyLoggerService` extends NestJS's `ConsoleLogger` and adds functionality to log requests to a file.
- The logs are saved under the `logs/` directory.

## Throttling

- **Short Timeout**: Limits to 5 requests per minute.
- **Long Timeout**: Limits to 100 requests per minute.

Throttling is implemented using `@nestjs/throttler` and helps in protecting against too many requests.

## Endpoints

### Employee CRUD Operations

- **POST /employees**: Create a new employee.
- **GET /employees**: Get all employees, optionally filter by role (`Intern`, `Engineer`, `Admin`).
- **GET /employees/:id**: Get a specific employee by ID.
- **PATCH /employees/:id**: Update an employee.
- **DELETE /employees/:id**: Delete an employee.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to manage employee data with rate limiting and custom logging. The NestJS framework combined with Prisma makes it easy to scale this application and add more features in the future.
